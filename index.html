                Do you want to learn to play the ukulele? <br />
                Do you want to learn how to teach it in school? <br />
                Do you want to make music with your friends? I LOVE teaching
                ukulele! <br />
                Search around this site to see how I can help, what ukulele
                services I offer, and why Iâ€™m your gal. <br />
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm fairly certain that given a cape and a nice tiara, I could
                teach anyone the ukulele.
