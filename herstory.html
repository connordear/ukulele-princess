          My name is Monica Dear and I teach Ukulele. Once upon a time...

          It's how many good stories begin. Music, always the music, it was like
          breathing. As a kid, I just sang. Junior Choir at church, piano
          lessons in grade 2, by grade 4, our principal Mr. Lightfoot had me
          accompanying our class singing. I think The Happy Wanderer was in
          there somewhere...

          <br /><br />
          Junior High band, the flute, Summer Camp, the guitar, High School
          Choir, College Choir, University Choir, a cappella choir, Music
          Education Degree. Job! And that’s when the whole ukulele thing
          started.

          <br /><br />
          Chalmers Doane was still going across our fair country to spread the
          gospel of uke. I was inspired then and really haven't stopped since,
          even when ukulele was dormant in much of the world for a time.

          <br /><br />
          My music teacher colleagues nicknamed me the Ukulele Princess of
          Sherwood Park. I am no longer officially that, but the shortened name
          is still uttered on occasion, the domain name was mine for the
          picking, and here we are.

          <br /><br />
          And now ukulele is back. And I can help you with that. You should know
          this is one of my very best things... I cannot change the oil in your
          car, perform a root canal, or frankly, tell the difference between a
          Megabyte and a kilowatt... I can, however, teach music teachers how to
          teach ukulele.

          <br /><br />
          I have enjoyed teaching ukulele to my students ever since the last
          century, even when it wasn’t "cool." I generally begin teaching
          ukulele to grade 4 students, by then they are chomping at the bit to
          learn. It is incredibly satisfying to see them bloom as musicians. So
          many concepts make sense and come alive through playing the ukulele.

          <br /><br />
          I love seeing teachers become brave enough to teach ukulele to their
          own students, with good pedagogy, technique, skills and a wide variety
          of repertoire. I share concepts, resources and strategies that I have
          developed over the years, incorporating new and current materials,
          from the best (and worst) that YouTube has to offer to the excellent
          resources developed by the acclaimed James Hill.
